# The test consists of three parts
# 1. Prepare load such that two transactions trx_1, trx_2 are clearly isolated
#    from each other on master thanks to forcing index.
# 2. Slave serial mode check ensures that the 1st prepared XA releases
#    "avariciously" acquired locks (the propertry A), as well as
#    the 2nd transaction is able to step over locked records (the B) to
#    successfully scan out its target one, instead of ending up with
#    the timeout error.
# 3. Slave parallel mode check aims at
#    the same as p.2 complicated by trx_2 having locked its target record
#    before trx_1 has started.
